GizmoE
======

Code Version Control repository for the project. Master always contains the current working code, while dev-ukd and dev-ss will contain the development versions of the code.

This repo essentially contains an Eclipse project. Please look at last merge to see dependencies. ActiveMQ should be running on default port.

The Demo Gui code has been given it's own repository, and can be found at https://github.com/Upsham/GizmoE_GUI_Demo
